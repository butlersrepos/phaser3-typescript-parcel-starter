# What?
This is a starter project for working with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

# How?
This has the typedefs built from phaser's docs repo + their source repo and committed to this project.

## WARNING
This means that if you upgrade the Phaser version in this project then the type definition may no longer be true.

# Why?
I love the assistance that comes with typings and the ease of use of Parcel.
